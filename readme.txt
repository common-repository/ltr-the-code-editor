Requires at least: 3.8
Stable tag: 0.2
Tested up to: 3.8.1

Temporarily fix a regression in WordPress 3.8, and set the theme/plugin editor to LTR. You can delete this plugin if you've upgraded to 3.8.1.

== Description ==

** Please update to 3.8.1 if you haven't already. This plugin isn't necessary anymore **

With WordPress 3.8, the theme/code editor is no longer forced to LTR when using WordPress in RTL mode. This plugin fixes that. Hopefully, the plugin won't be necessary with the next version of WordPress.
